This blog is just for ramblings about infosec industry, personal experiences and some of the tips for governance. 

A little bit about me, I have over 10 years of experience in different fields of IT and information security. I started as system operator/computer technician, been system and network administrator, IT manager and telecommunication design consultant. Information security responsibilities were always part of my job duties, so in 2010 I was lucky to get a position of information security officer, making my switch from IT to security field an official one. I did clock up many hours studying and doing various projects related to governance, ISMS, standards and compliance as well as risk assessment. I do not do professional penetration tests, it is more of a hobby for me. I have been consultant and full-time employee, freelancing and just passing time in search of inspiration.

The aim of this blog is to help me keep working on my writing skills, professional development and as a by-product share something I know.

Should you like to get in touch, drop me an email or comment, but be nice. I know my style and grammar are far from perfect. I will work on it. Opinions are welcome, obvious trolling is not(if you'd like to troll, please at least make an effort).
