### Cookie Policy for Security Ramblings

This blog uses cookies and this page explains what cookies are, how I use cookies, how third­parties I may partner with may use cookies on the blog, your choices regarding cookies and further information about cookies. I will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or ‘break’ certain elements of the sites functionality.

##### What Are Cookies


As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies. Cookies are small pieces of text sent by your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the blog or a third­party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Service more useful to you.
Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies.

##### How I Use Cookies

This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solution on the web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.

For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the official [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) page.

##### Disabling Cookies

You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.

Website visitors can prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics by using *Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on* for the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js).
If you want to opt-out, download and install the add-on for your web browser. The Google Analytics opt-out add-on is designed to be compatible with Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, Firefox and Opera. In order to function, the opt-out add-on must be able to load and execute properly on your browser. For Internet Explorer, 3rd-party cookies must be enabled. [Learn more](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) about about the opt-out and how to properly install the browser add-on.

##### More Information

Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren’t sure whether you need or not it’s usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.
