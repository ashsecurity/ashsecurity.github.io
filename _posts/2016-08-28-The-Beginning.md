In the beginning there was an idea. It was not grand, unique or somewhat inspiring. Idea was to start blogging. I wanted to keep posting something to improve my English writing skills as well as improve grammar, at the same time, I wanted to keep records of what I have experienced so far or voice an opinion about topic I came across (_not that anyone cares_). 

My career is built around information security, so it was an easy choice of what to write about, be it something I find interesting or related to infosec, although I know I can get side tracked and ramble about something totally unrelated. I do find infosec a quite interesting and engaging subject. Having said that, when working in this industry, one should always exercise self-irony and be down-to-earth kind of a pro. Otherwise, constant stress of something not going your way, ignorance, FUD and budget constraints will drive you to the ground without any results.

When choosing the platform for my blog, I have decided to give  **[Github Pages]( https://pages.github.com/)**, **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)** and **[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)** a try. Partially, because I was swept away with [Blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) headline by Tom Preston-Werner, but mostly because I want to keep myself more engaged in web development, improving coding skills and scripting, which I completely forgot how to do.  Thankfully, Jekyll has many themes and templates to start with and customize later.

**DISCLOSURE:** Posts I will publish will be heavily opinionated, stubborn and for some of you simply wrong. That is fine. I do subscribe to belief that truth is born in the discussion, argument and statement challenges. So drop me an email, twit or comment. I might not reply, but I will read. 

So here we are. 

The genesis.
