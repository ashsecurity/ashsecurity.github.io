### Intro 

The idea for this post has been developing for quite some time. I finally decided to write some mind drops about
recruitment process when couple of my ex-colleagues contacted me to inform that some recruiter was calling them to verify my credentials and work history. The catch is that I did not authorize any recruiter to do so. In fact I was not even looking for a new work place.  

### Why all the fuss?
Simple. Infosec guy naturally assumes the worst. So I did, hence the post :) Obviously there is some element of social engineering threat, distant but clever. You can get all sorts of information about company if asked properly.  

### Recruiters are humans too

You may be surprised but recruiters are not the all-powerful demigods holding the keys to your employment. They are humans doing their job of finding the "talent" for their clients. Some recruiters are good at what they do, and some are not. Nowadays for many people it became a norm of being constantly afraid to loose a job. So I get the recruiter assuming that making background check, without informing potential client first, is OK. Especially if there is a real opportunity to offer. 

### Do it the CA way!
I hate the "call-to-action" posts on social media, especially those on LinkedIn. However, when I found out about the unsolicited background check I had to send a warning to my connections and the unknown recruiter. The question was how to do it in the right way, so not to offend those who genuinely wanted to help. I figured the formula of trusted CA would work in my case. 
Just as a client asking the trusted CA server to verify if the presented certificate is trustworthy, I would appoint myself as the certificate authority to act as the trusted third party for the recruiters and my colleagues. Therefore, in one post I asked my LinkeIn connections to direct the recruiter to contact me first. I would verify to the colleague over message that:
<ul> 
<li>Background check is valid and I know of it; </li>
<li>Recruiter may ask any questions. </li>
<li>...Profit</li>
</ul>
That way the recruiter would be authorized and my colleague would know that it is fine to provide any information. 

### In conclusion advance your career...

Take a measured approach. It is important to constantly evaluate your knowledge on a professional level. Go for a new certification, challenge yourself to learn something new or master additional domain of security, just don't do one thing: Never, ever ask someone on social media to help you out with new career path or deciding on what new certification to take. That just points out that you do not have a clear plan. Fight your own battles, do not make someone pick one for you.  
Make sure that your application answers the requirements or be prepared to waste time on fruitless interviews again and again. Read the job post. 
Do not ever assume that recruiter will cut you some slack if you do not match the job requirements. Remember, no recruiter has any obligation to do this and the most likely will not. What's going to happen is your CV will go straight to the bin.
Do not lie in the CV. You may fool the recruiter but not the second line interviewer. 90% of people I have interviewed could not tell what IPS and firewall were, 70% never seen console, and that is despite claiming information security experience. Can you imagine how frustrated I would be when "governance professional" could not give a simple definition of what the risk is?
