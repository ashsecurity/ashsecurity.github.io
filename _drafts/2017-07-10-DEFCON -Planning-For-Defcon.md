### Intro

So as everyone knows, Defcon is canceled this year. That is why I've decided to go anyway. Since it is my first visit to Las Vegas and Defcon, I think that the Defcon Diaries may come in handy for those planning to attend in the future.

### Getting there 

My decision was half-spontaneous. I planned to go to the Defcon for some time now, but could never get to the that breaking point of actually planning the trip. This time though stars aligned in the right direction, but quite late. Because of that I have missed some good deals on air-tickets and hotel stays. 
So don't fall into the same trap. Your decision to actually go should come not more than 2 days after Defcon date announcement. One should keep in mind that this conference is one of the largest and it attracts a great deal of all sort of folks. 
Get your air-tickets arranged immediately after announcement and hotel stay in one-two days after. 
Your visa should be done in advance. Defcon happens right after the Black Hat, so it is safe to say the dates will fall on end of July beginning of August. 

### Workshops

Reserving your seat at workshop is done online. Links for reservations are posted on the Defcon website under the workshop section, but they activate at specific time. You should reserve it immediately at the time of their activation. Delay WILL result in missed opportunity, since so many people wants to attend workshops. 
I would advise to pick workshop topics that are interesting to you well in advance so not to scroll through he topics after links activation. 

I was lucky to reserve a seat in one of the workshops. Nice!
